# Lesson 7.4 - Static Members

The last thing we're going to talk about with regards to classes is static
members. Static members allow you to create methods on a class that are not
bound to any instance of the class. Let's look at a `Rectangle` class for
instance:

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, length) {
    this.width = width
    this.length = length
  }

  static square(width) {
    return new Rectangle(width, width)
  };
}
```

That's interesting! Let's see this in action!

```bash
> var square = Rectangle.square(10)
> square.width
-> 10
> square.length
-> 10
```

As you can see, we were able to call the `square` method on the `Rectangle`
class without creating a new instance of it. This is useful for situtations
like we showed above, and also just for wrapping up code that is relevant to
a specific class, but doesn't rely on any instance properties of the class to
be useful.

## Moving on
That's it for classes, and that's it for the Diving Into ES2015 course! Thanks
for joining me, and you are now ready to dive into ES2015 and use all of the
great new features it has to offer!

TODO - list out the great features not covered with a short synopsis?
