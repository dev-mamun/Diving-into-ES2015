# Lesson 5.1 - Arrow Functions

When working in JavaScript, the lexical scoping of `this` often causes a lot
of problems with newer developers (and seasoned veterans at times). This can
be overcome, however, with the use of `Function.prototype.bind`. This will
change code that looks like this:

```js
let self = this;

fetch('www.google.com').then(function(response) {
  self.name = response.body.name;
});
```

to this:

```js
fetch('www.sitepoint.com').then(function(response) {
  this.name = response.body.name;
}.bind(this));
```

As you can see, we have avoided assigning an otherwise useless variable by
simply binding the function to `this`. This works fine, but it can get a little
tedious, and it can be easy to forget.

Have no fear! ES2015 has your back with a new feature called `arrow functions`.
Arrow functions automagically bind to the lexical `this`, so no need for
`bind(this)`!

That function from above can now be written as:

```js
fetch('www.sitepoint.com').then((response) => {
  this.name = response.body.name;
})
```

TODO - more examples of what lexical this...?

Wow, that's awesome! It also allows you to use some shorthand syntaxes that
come in really handy, and often times make your code easier to read. For instance,
you can force an implicit return statement by enclosing the function call in
parentheses instead of curly braces:

```js
fetch('www.sitepoint.com').then((response) => (
  response.body.name;
));
```

The above function is equivalent to the following:

```js
fetch('www.sitepoint.com').then((response) => {
  return response.body.name;
});
```

You can even leave out the parentheses altogether!

```js
fetch('www.sitepoint.com').then(response => response.body.name);
```

or with destructuring

```js
fetch('www.sitepoint.com').then(({ body: { name } }) => name);
```

Wow! Now that's something. No more endless indentations for one line callback
functions.

## Moving on
Well, this was a short lesson, but I am fairly certain that you will be using
this new ES2015 feature more than just about any other. Let's move on and
use this in some realy life examples with our ever evolving receipt calculator.
